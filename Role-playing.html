<p>Overview: Baldurs gate is much like the popular game dnd (Dungeons and Dragons), it has single player and multiplayer elements and has a turn base attack system
</p>
    
<p>Opinionated review: I think Baldurs gate is a nice game. I like that you can choose which classes and sub-classes you can choose, and also choose which race you want to play as. This game gives me the ability to either be evil or good. You can create parties with real life people or even npc's. You can also fall inlove and have a good time with the npc's as well

Overview: World of Warcraft is an mmorpg where you care in the world of Azeroth where you create an avatar to fight monsters and npc's, explore dungeons and eventually go up against the final boss to defeat him in battle. There are other things that you can also do in World of Warcraft
</p>

<p3>Things you can do in World of Warcraft
<li>Gathering resources</li>
<li>Battling other players</li>
<li>Mastering crafts like Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, Tailoring, etc</li> 
</p3>
 
<p>Opinionated review: I think World of Warcraft is an interesting game where you can create your own avatar, choosing which race you want, and just essentially doing whatever you want. I like that you are able to make your own weapons and sell them. I find it cool that you can fish and even find and sell erbs to alchemist, and you can even become a master alchemist. Cooking is another thing that you can do to get buffs and increased stats
